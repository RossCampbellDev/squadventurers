&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smimsbing</a>'s wealthy and easy upbringing is evident from just a quick glance.&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothing is nicer than everyone else's, he smells better and his hands are soft and pink from never having done a day's genuine work in his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has the more expensive equipment thanks to daddy, but is very much the classic case of 'all the gear and no idea' as he is totally unprepared for life outside of a posh villa full of servants.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first sign of danger, toil, dirt or confrontation he begins quaking in his gentlemanly boots and looks for the first way out of the situation - though he rarely escapes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He's taller than <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a>, though his lanky skeleton and awful posture (from a life spent hunched over reading terribly written comedies and fantasy novels) give him a weak and wilting appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears his reddish-brown hair short and neat, not too dissimilar to <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a>'s fashionable mop, and he tries his darndest to grow a beard but only manages some shading of the upper lip and a few wisps on his cheeks.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> could be quite the handsome and well-to-do man if he bucked up and sorted himself out with some exercise and some socialising practise - but his problem is he's too scared to even begin and too lazy to to follow through if he even got started!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the professional side of things, <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> doesn't really have much of a role.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> brought him on board because of the potential for using him as a source of money - and because at the time he also didn't have anybody else in his planned adventuring organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;He does try to be useful, mostly by acting as a sort of assistant and clerk, but mostly he gets in the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the fighting he's worse than useless, much to the amusement of <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> also tries in vain to buddy up with the two older men because he desperately wants to be one of the boys, but it doesn't really work out for him since he is just far too different.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are rough-around-the-edges banter-brawlers while <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> is a polite and proper manner-monger.&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't stop him from trying though, and why not?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In his interactions with the rest of the group <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> varies greatly.&nbsp;&nbsp;He adores and respects <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> and is the only member who is really impressed by his claims of knighthood and glory and honour and all that.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> is pretty intimidated by <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is everything he is not - confrontational, strong-willed, streetwise, and chummy with <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;She does seem to have something of a soft spot for him though, and often helps him silently out of any jams he finds himself in.&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came to his crush on <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a> tried to help <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> past the first hurdle in her own blunt way, and while it nearly gave him a heart attack, he appreciated it all the same.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> is deeply fascinated by her and would give anything to eat delicious eight course meals with her on the family estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's from a similar background, so he feels that he may have more in common with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course he actually doesn't, and if she weren't so adorable he'd probably be the first to mock her for her belief in magic crystals... but sacrifices must be made for true love right?<br />
