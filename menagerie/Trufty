<div class=char-sub-header>Appearance</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he has the glorious mane of hair and angular, almost beautiful facial structure that one might expect, 'Sir' <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Lymon Truft</a> is a little lacking in the physical stature department.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's got just about enough height, but there's no way he'd stand in a shield wall and hold his ground against a legion of minotaur weightlifters.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is potential there, but he is young and not properly conditioned to physical hardship yet - that's why he's in an adventuring organisation after all, to get experience and training.<br /><div class=char-sub-header>Personality And Goals</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> is a pretty unique individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;His first priority when meeting new people is to inform them that he is a knight - although of course he is only a knight-in-self-training and not actually qualified yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;This puts a certain image in their head when people hear it, and when they take in the majesty that is <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> they become confused.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not the typical knightly figure by a long stretch.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to combat, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> is certainly not afraid to tell everyone how unafraid he is of facing down evil, though he is not particularly skilled or proven.&nbsp;&nbsp;He does have one advantage however, in that he wields an heirloom sword that was passed down to him by his father, a true knight of the Order of the White Swan of Goldlilyhampton-on-blythe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it's a little on the old fashioned side, the sword is a magnificent piece of craftsmanship and has seen his father through many great battles with it's wonderful balance and enduring edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might say it was wasted on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a>, but the young knight-to-be has plenty of time and opportunity to earn it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;One other knightly possession that <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> has is his mighty steed, Horace Winghoof.&nbsp;&nbsp;A gallant horse that has more combat experience than the rest of the group combined.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas poor Horace has seen better days and, were he human, he'd be busy sitting in a rocking chair and soiling himself as he waited for death's final embrace.&nbsp;&nbsp;That didn't stop <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> recruiting <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> pretty much entirely for his horsey accolades - it was purely an image thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wanted to be a serious adventurer, you had to have a horse.<br /><div class=char-sub-header>Relationships</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> is a pretty unique individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;His first priority when meeting new people is to inform them that he is a knight -
