&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting Captain <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Esmeldrana>Esmeldrana</a> is the epitome of the obsessive intellectual.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is extremely orderly in the way she approaches the challenges of life, which can lead to supreme performance in many aspects, but total oblivious failure in others.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is never to be found more than two feet from a notebook and pencil and compulsively takes notes on daily events.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time she is unsure of herself she habitually goes to the blessed book of wisdom to read up on anything she might have missed.&nbsp;&nbsp;'By the book' is her middle name, and the word 'joke' is not in that book.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Her role is that of a consulting investigator - hence her temporary title of Acting Captain of the town guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was brought on to look into the serial murders due to her excessive attention to detail and puzzle solving talent - though she didn't get very far into her investigation before finding some possible suspects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once she's on the trail she's like an energetic and focused bloodhound, giving all her attention to solving the problem as soon as possible - which occasionally leads her to premature decisions.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to interactions with people <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Esmeldrana>Esmeldrana</a> is not hopeless, but she can be difficult and is certainly not afraid of confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;People rarely know the right approach to actually get anywhere with her, but when they figure it out they realise that she is just a very logical and rule-bound person.&nbsp;&nbsp;Break those rules and you will get a stern talking to though.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not endear her to people like <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Free spirits who think that rules are nothing but a nuisance that hold people back from the true joy of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two immediately came to loggerheads when they met, and it is a feud that is unlikely to ever abate since they are simply polar opposite personalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to appearance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Esmeldrana>Esmeldrana</a>'s character is consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wears simple and pragmatic clothing that is appropriate to whatever task is at hand - while retaining a certain level of formality that befits her temporary rank.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her equipment is always kept in perfect condition and is protected and repaired to make it last as long as possible and never let her down.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite her orderly nature, her hair is usually a little on the messy side which shows her absent-mindedness towards the less significant things in life.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As with <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a>, she is not necessarily the most experienced person in the world, especially when it comes to field work, and so she often places her authoritative visage in jeopardy by having to check her notes or backtrack on things she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;A weakness of hers is that those in positions of authority are simply beyond recourse to her, and so she will be too agreeable with those people.<br />
