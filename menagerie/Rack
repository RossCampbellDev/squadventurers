&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Rack>Rack</a> is the classic adonis alpha male.&nbsp;&nbsp;His jaw is so square he could rent it out to architects for drawing up blueprints, and his stubble never clocks in a minute past five.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is he far taller than average, he has broad shoulders that taper down to a narrow waist encased in protective and aesthetic abdominal muscles, and even his calves are in good shape!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He has straight golden hair, a few inches in length and flopping so perfectly that you might even think he put time into it - though of course he did not.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was much too rugged to spend any time on his appearance.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, his clothing is appalling, his wardrobe choices could only have been influenced by the homeless people shivering away on the city streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are patchy and ill fitting and they smell - and yet because it is <a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Rack>Rack</a> who wears them it somehow works.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an effortless swagger and confidence that draws everything within a 5 foot radius like some kind of sexy black hole.<br />And you would too with a face like that!&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are such a piercingly bright green that they practically glow in the dark.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony with <a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Rack>Rack</a> however is that though he is confident (and charming women comes as easily to him as breathing) he has one not-so-subtle insecurity.&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes himself a little slow and dim, despite in reality being of average intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;This self doubt seems to stem from some pathology lying within that no amount of bar wenches or beer can resolve.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By profession, <a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Rack>Rack</a> is apparently some kind of rogue - an information gatherer, door opener, contact-maker.&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't look the part, though his scruffy clothing may help him with disguising himself, but he does seem to have a knack for the dungeoneering business - as well as fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any athletic pursuit is pretty much a given talent for <a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Rack>Rack</a> with his strength and excellent coordination.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Rack>Rack</a> gets along well with everybody he meets and socialising is effortless for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;His deep voice and slow cadence are simply so charming and comforting that people cannot help but want to befriend him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being around such a man makes people feel great, and they laugh and smile more.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a> in particular loves being around <a href=http://www.squadventurers.co.uk/bio/Rack>Rack</a> and flirting playfully, and he's perfectly happy to verbally (and sometimes physically) spar with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are both somewhat free-spirited so there is no awkwardness or implication to their actions, it is simple good fun!<br />
