&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> is rock personified.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hard to believe he was actually born to a human mother, rather than that he simply broke off a cliff face one day and rolled down a mountainside, coming to a stop at the bottom in a roughly human shape.<br />He's far shorter than <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a> and Bydalo, and even makes <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> look tall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a> he is of a similar height, though due to his massively swollen muscles he appears larger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the height disparity, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> weighs more than the mighty <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a> and is not at all concerned about throwing this weight around.&nbsp;&nbsp;His manner could be described as that of an excitable rhino with impaired vision and total lack of apology - though he is always as equally jovial as he is prickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, he is extremely likeable as you always know where you stand with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only time he's ever beaten about the bush would maybe have been in a past life as a boar.<br /><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a>'s head is exquisitely cleanly shaven and he takes great pride in his dome acting as a reflector of light and awkward faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;This pride pales into insignificance next to the love he has for his awe-inspiring red moustache though, which dominates his upper lip and branches out before his cheeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> to have so much as a stray hair, and to keep things under control he always keeps some wax handy and will constantly be tweaking and twizzling and smoothing himself down like a self conscious gorilla.&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing his moustache movements is an excellent way to gauge <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a>'s feelings (if his words and actions weren't already obvious enough).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ever the showman, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> loves being a professional strongman.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger the object, and the larger the crowd there to observe, the happier <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no arrogant show-off however, but more like an entertainer and competitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can do it harder, heavier or faster than someone else, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> will do it no questions asked.<br />Never known to back down from a fight, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> is a lethal force with any kind of weapon - improvised or not - and possibly even more so without one.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing getting more destroyed than <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a>'s opponents is any food to be found in the vicinity.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of his time is spent chumming around with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a>, making silly jokes and being boisterous and cheerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are both very entertaining and keep everyone's spirits up with their antics, though there is the occasional fracas when <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> knocks something over or smashes something - but that's just par for the course!<br />
