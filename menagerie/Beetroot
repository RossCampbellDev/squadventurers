&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there to say about Ol' <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Beetroot>Beetroot</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;He's been around the block several thousand times in his long and degenerate life, and he's not afraid to recite a few tales of the glory days to anyone who will listen (or at least politely pretend to, while really looking for an excuse to leave)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the day of course, he was a stud.&nbsp;&nbsp;The alpha male.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Demigod among men.&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn't walk down the street without girls fainting around him.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what he'd tell you anyway.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the fibs he constantly preaches, nothing is truly known about <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Beetroot>Beetroot</a>'s past (such as how he got his ridiculous name, if it even is his real name).&nbsp;&nbsp;His present is a lonely existence, rotting away in a mouldering old farmhouse and slowly going insane.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since his main source of company is his sheep (reknowned for being the most handsome sheep around mind you!) he has a habit of talking to animals and inanimate objects as if they can understand him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He's a lech and a pervert, and young women would be advised to steer clear of him unless they've got a penchant for administering violent lessons in behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;Young sheep would also be well advised to avoid him, if you could somehow communicate it to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many nasty rumours about <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Beetroot>Beetroot</a>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As an old farmhand, he is almost bent double due to his awful back problems - his spinal discs bulge more than <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Brob')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a>'s muscles - and this is worsened by age which is slowly pulling him down towards the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually it'll get him properly and he'll end up six feet down, but until then he'll continue boozing and generally being unpleasant.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears simple, raggedy clothing that hasn't seen a wash (never mind a repair) for several years and stinks to high heaven, and atop his head is a home made straw hat that is fraying around the edges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath this hat sits his weatherbeaten mush, a ruddy-brown cacophony of wrinkles with some patchy white beard drooping from it and beady little black eyes squinting out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having lost most of his teeth, his face looks almost squashed, giving it a comical look.<br />
