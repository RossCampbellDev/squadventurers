&nbsp;&nbsp;Some folk out there are home birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are born in a place, they work there and create families there, and then they are buried there with the rest of their (probably inbred) family.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Orpington <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Batchley>Batchley</a>, he is the direct opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's traveled so much of the universe, so many worlds, that he couldn't be said to come from anywhere in particular - though he is fiercely proud to have grown up on the world known as 'Towndon', a place where all things proper and polite are held in high esteem.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From a young age he grew restless and had a strong urge to wander off and not return home until he'd seen everything there was to see - for life was far too interesting for staying put!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result he began journeying across the various planes of existence, meeting all manner of beings and people and sharing a cup of tea with all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was always well received and sent on his way with good wishes, and has made a vast network of friends and contacts over his extended lifespan.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, his body is outwardly rotten and crippled, smelly and disgusting as a result of having escaped true death, but not natural decay, with all his plane-walking escapades.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this he is not alone though, as along with a bunch of other travelers that are commonly referred to as 'ghouls' despite their usually sunny disposition he frequents 'Ghoul Town' in between trips - a place where the not-quite-dead congregate and share stories of where they've been.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Though many of the other Ghoulish types have gone desperately senile, Orpington <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Batchley>Batchley</a> retains his sharp wit and effortless charisma even at over one-hundred-and-forty years old, and neither has he lost any of his good humour.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's ever-ready to help out those who are polite and well-meaning.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothes, like his body, are ragged and decayed and falling to pieces, but one day long ago they would have looked splendid and immaculate, and would have marked him out as a fine gentleman.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he could replace the clothes, <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Batchley>Batchley</a> prefers to retain his simple and consistant outward appearance rather than try fruitlessly to disguise his hideous form underneat.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has full confidence in his character, and as such feels no need to dress up for others!<br />
