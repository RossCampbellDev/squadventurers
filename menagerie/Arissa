<div class=char-sub-header>Appearance</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;She is well dressed in smart-looking and functional rangering clothing, but somehow also manages to make it look stylish.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair is always immaculately braided and arranged in a way that would remind you of a younger girl, which is an outward reflection of <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a>'s youthful spirit - literally everything is exciting and fun to her and she cannot contain her optimism most of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to her salon-quality hair she also has flawless makeup done to a level befitting the ladies of the court, and always looks on point when on a mission!<br /><div class=char-sub-header>Personality</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a> is, like <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a>, from a wealthy background. You might even say she was spoiled, although despite this she is nowhere close to being as sheltered as he is, and she's certainly got bigger balls!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange dichotomy of <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a> is that though she may be the pretty, feminine, fashionable rich girl, she is also most at home out in the wilds of nature, roughing it on the rocks with only a fur to sleep on.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's spent hundreds of hours learning bushcraft and tracking skills, interacting with animals, learning how to be a proficient archer/slinger, and as such is probably the most professionally skilled in the whole group (unless you count breaking things as a profession, in which case <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Brob')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> gives her a run for her money).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a>'s daddy paid for her training while the others who weren't so lucky were busy doing child labour or running around the streets - so it makes sense that she's the most qualified.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Around her neck can be seen a 'magic' crystal that is mounted into a simple metal casing and suspended on a humble chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;This crystal is actually one of several which <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a> normally carries and changes out depending on her mood.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is obsessed with the magic within and is determined to teach herself how to use it one day - since the nice lady selling them told her she had the gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> humours this ridiculous notion, but then he is willing to suspend all rationality in the hopes of winning <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a>'s attention.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the group think it's a load of nonsense, but are generally too polite to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone is so excitable and cheerful you feel like a horrible bastard for deflating them, even if you're completely in the right!<br /><div class=char-sub-header>Goals</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite her sunshine personality and girly demeanour, <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a> is no pushover and no soft petal either.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is perfectly ready to get into a scrap and dish out some damage - having been trained by another one of daddy's hired tutors to be proficient in hand to hand combat as well as with her ranged weapons... much to the enraged <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Sephra')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a>'s chagrin in one particular encounter...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to goals, <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a>'s are unclear.&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be adventuring more for the experience and the fun of it than because she has any specific goals - it may not be the most specific of lifestyles, but she seems content enough!<br /><div class=char-sub-header>Relationships</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to inter-personal skills, <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a> isn't the worst amongst them because she is so upbeat, but she doesn't exactly focus on the matter at hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does she have much of use to say a lot of the time, being mostly preoccupied with animals and nature and crystals.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be frustrating for most of the group to try and talk to her, so she tends to stick with <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Trufty')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> whom she gets along with fabulously, the prissy knight being as interested in hairstyles as she is has lead to them becomes besties for life.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Though <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> is quite obviously smitten with her, <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Arissa')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Arissa>Arissa</a> either seems not to notice - or pretends not to.&nbsp;&nbsp;She expertly avoids the subject without insulting him, and manages to remain polite and friendly anyway.
