Some of us were born with the rare ability to hammer a nail in without requiring surgery afterwards!” <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> snapped, his words leaking derision.  He had delegated the task of posting up the ‘adventurers wanted’ flier to the weedy <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>sbing in the hope that the little rich git would manage it on his own, thus leaving <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> free to gawp at some nearby dancing ladies.  Alas, the greasy-haired son of a wealthy figure of local ‘government’ had proceeded to whack the hammer onto his own pampered hand.  It was very possible that his eye had left the tip of the nail and landed on some jiggling beauties precisely at the critical moment.  “OW!  ow-ow-ow-ow owee!  Sorry <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>, Sir, I uh… I’m not much good with a hammer.  Father always had men do that sort of thing for us” <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>sbing mewled, sucking tenderly at his now purplish-red thumb.    “More likely you were leering at those dancing women!  Sort yourself out <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>, you’re embarrassing me” <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> replied, perfectly aware of his hypocrisy but not particularly worried about <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>sbing standing up to him.  If he was honest with himself, <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> didn’t really like <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> all that much.  He was a bit of a wimp and a suck-up, and was constantly making his sheltered upbringing painfully evident.  That upbringing, however, was exactly why <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> had made <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> the second in command of his planned adventuring organisation.  <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>’s father had a hoard of wealth and wasn’t afraid to splash it on his son, especially when his son was getting booted into the world of monster slaying and so forth in an attempt to toughen him up - although <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> seemed unwilling to actually ask for the money or share it when he did have some.    Though he’d have preferred somebody more naturally heroic, <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> was more than happy to make use of <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>’s pocket money if he had the chance.  He would find some real warriors once his flier was answered.  “When do we start the interviews Sir?  I’ve prepared some good questions!”  <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> asked, trying to redeem himself it seemed.  He also couldn’t wait to get to <a href=bio/Pantaloons>The Crusty Pantaloons</a> for a drink.  “Obviously on the time and date I’ve written on the flier we’ve just posted.  I’m not surprised you didn’t notice, considering you weren’t even looking in the general direction of what you were hammering.”   <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> blushed slightly as he remembered quite clearly reading the time and date and supposedly committing them to memory.    “So what do we do until then, sir?”  “I’ve got a few property viewings lined up.  Once we’ve got a squad going, we’ll need a decent headquarters building for the team to meet and prepare in before missions.  If you’re going to be a serious organisation that gets all the best jobs, you have to have a proper headquarters or everybody will think you’re just a bunch of wasters that met in an inn, downed five pints, and then decided to become famous heroes.”  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> replied.  He had begun walking in the direction of one of the houses that they were to view.  Sadly, it was across town and would probably take them half an hour to reach.  That left far too much time for <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> to talk uninterrupted about his exciting plans for a job request and customer fulfillment system.    Upon arriving at the first building, <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> immediately realised that it would be out of their price range.  His means were modest, even when bolstered by <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>’s pocket money, and he fully expected to be investing all of his meagre fiscal portfolio into a rat infested storage shed.  A man was waiting outside who looked as though he was trying to dress smartly but couldn’t quite afford it. He was balding so violently that <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> was reminded of sailors escaping a sinking ship.  He could only have been the man in charge of selling the property on.  “Ah! You would be mister-” The man began.  “<a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>.  Just call me <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>”  No sense letting <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> know his real surname.  The embarrassment would be fatal.  “Right you are mister <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>! My name is <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> but perhaps you’ve heard of my trading name - Honest <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a>’s Housing?  No?  Well I suppose you must be new to town.  No Matter.  Step this way, I have the key to this magnificent establishment here somewhere…” He replied while rummaging in a pouch frantically.  Once he found the key, he opened the ornate wooden door to the front of the building.  No creaking, no escaping bats, no smell of urine.  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> sighed inwardly, dreaming of what might have been if he had some more cash.  “So what we have here is a modern warehouse design that was commissioned by an historic trading group and built by a local architect who was at the time quite renowned for his work in brick laying technology”  The salesman sermoned, obviously trying hard to sound enthusiastic and engaged.  He carried on making his sales pitch, but <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> wasn’t really listening.  He was trying to think of an excuse to give to <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> as to why they wouldn’t buy this place, rather than have to admit that he didn’t have the money.  It wouldn’t do for an excellent leader of noble heroes to be too poor now, would it?  “... Exquisite workings on the window frames and doors, I’m sure you’ll agree?”  “Oh yes, fantastic” <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> said, feeling like he’d revealed too much sarcasm.  Apparently <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> hadn’t noticed at all.  In fact, he seemed quite content to blather on and listen to his own voice, so <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> left him to it.  After they finished the tour, they thanked <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> and told him that they’d think about the property, but that they must move on to another viewing before missing their appointment.  “Excellent news, I believe I saw the glint of buying lust in your eyes mister <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>!  I’ve a funny feeling that you’ll be back for this place!” <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> said, all but winking roguishly as he laid a too-friendly hand on <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>’s shoulder.  He obviously didn’t realise that he was completely wrong.   “I say, you wouldn’t happen to be viewing Thirteen <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> next would you?” He added.  “Actually yes, that was our next stop.  I suppose you’re showing it too?”  “That would be me yes indeed, but I don’t think you’ll be needing to see that place!”  He said with a knowing smile.  Ugh.  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> hated when people assumed things about him.  “What’s wrong with it?”  “I take it you’ve never even heard of <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> then!”  <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> said incredulously.  “Well.  I guess I can sum it up quite succinctly by saying that <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> is rather aptly named.  Does that help?”  The wink was more than implied this time.  “Doesn’t sound great, but I guess it can’t hurt to have a look.  Compare what’s on offer and all that”  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> said.  And so they set off in the direction of <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a>, <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> noticing the gradual change from ‘desirable’ property to ‘liveable’, then on to ‘prison would be better’.  The terror didn’t stop there, though.  They dropped a further rung on the proverbial ladder and came to pause at the foot of <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a>, a long corridor of houses that were obviously put together by people with no idea what they were doing.  <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> could not have looked more out of place, and was quite obviously worried that he’d be stabbed and robbed at any second.  For once in his life, his anxiety might have been justified.  “As you see mister <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>, it’s the complete opposite of the wonderful trading district we just came from.  A distinguished man such as yourself would hardly be well represented here!”  <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> was right for once.  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> was a distinguished man - or so he told himself.  “Well we are here now, so we might as well go for a look around” The young man responded.  He was dreading the thought of having to set up operations in a place like this, but as he had been reminded while shifting his money pouch to a less visible spot, he couldn’t afford better.  They set off down the lane, occasionally slipping in nondescript dark sludge that none of them dared to look too closely at.  After a few minutes, <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> stopped before the doorway to what must presumably be the building.  There was no number thirteen to be seen, but it must have been the place, judging by how dreadful it looked.  The front of the building was a shambling mound of mouldering wood and struggling moss, emanating a damp odour and creaking like an old pirate ship.  It seemed to be three stories high, with the top floor in much better condition and with real window shutters.  “Is the top floor part of the property we’re viewing?”  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> enquired.  “No I’m afraid not, that floor belongs to a separate … ‘business’ shall we say.  A very ancient profession, if you catch my drift!  Don’t worry though, they have their own entrace on the other side of the building - nice and quiet round there!”  Fantastic.  It was going to be fun trying to sleep at night in this place...  <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> nudged <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> jovially with his elbow and began rummaging around his pockets for the key.  He stopped abruptly as if remembering something.  “Ah! this place, um, requires a familiar touch.” He said awkwardly, before proceeding to kick the stiff and ill-fitted front door inwards.  “If you’ll… follow me gents...this is-” He broke off mid sentence with a ladylike yelp that he tried valiantly hard to disguise as a cough.  “Sorry, thought it was a rat.”    <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> looked dubiously at what he thought looked more like the fossilized remains of human feces.  “So anyway, this is the reception area.  I’m sure you’ll agree it’s definitely an exciting development opportunity?  Plenty of space, but still cosy-feeling with the low ceiling.”  The ceiling in question was actually sagging in the middle, almost scraping the top of their heads.  It looked, like the rest of <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a>, as though it was struggling with great inner turmoil and had all but given up.  “Let’s take a look at the upstairs <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a>, if the ceiling will hold our weight?” <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> prompted.  “Oh don’t worry yourself mister <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>, these old houses have stood the test of time and have really shown some character to still be here! Wonderful construction…” <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a>’s tone should have sounded confident, but even the fossilized poop could detect his complete lack of belief.  They made the death-defying ascent up the rickety staircase that reminded them of a stack of crates and came to the landing, which looked much like the barren reception area.  Everything was built from old, partially rotted wood that was covered in dubious stains and had nails sticking out all over the place.  A quick exploration revealed that there were several well-sized rooms on the first floor, each very similar to the reception area downstairs, complemented by a garderobe toilet towards the back of the building.  <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> almost fainted when he opened the door and saw the wooden bench with the round hole cut out of it, and then the long drop to a pile of profound obscenity.  The likes of which would ne’er be seen again in this world, nor on any plane of existence.  <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> led them around a few more small rooms of the building, including what <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> assumed was supposed to be a kitchen downstairs.  There was even a basement, which might prove useful for storage - if they could clean out the ecosystem of disease ridden animals first.    As they left the building, <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> turned to them to conclude the day.  He informed them of the price and showed <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> the deed to the building, the previous owner being listed simply as ‘Skeggy’ and having a rough ‘X’ to mark their signature.  There was a small green stain that <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> was sure had originated in someone’s nose.  “Well mister <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>, shall i start drawing up the deal for the first property?” <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> asked, in a hurry to get out of <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> and to make some money.  “Actually <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a>, i think we’ll take <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a>’s finest if you would be so kind”  <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> almost fainted for the second time that day.  What had Father got him in for?  He desperately wanted to go back home for a scented bath that might wash away the traumatic memories of the dreaded toilet.  “Sir! You can’t be serious? We men of great distinction surely deserve better…” He said quietly to <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>, perhaps hoping to sway his decision with a little flattery.  “Come on <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>, this place is a steal and as <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> said, it’s a great development opportunity.  With some work, this place will be a great headquarters.”  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> wished he believed that.  Again he felt the weight of his money pouch and sighed inwardly.  This is what it had come to already?  <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>’s knees quivered and he felt queasy.  He was going to have to sit on that wooden bench, with his little soldier hanging down that hole above the pile of terror.  A strong urge to run away in any direction filled him.  <a href=bio/Heb>Heb</a> thought it best to get the deal finished before any second thoughts grew too strong.    “Right you are sir, I’m sure you’ll have this place polished up in no time! If you’ll just sign the deed and make the financial transaction, seventy-three <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> will be yours!” He announced, looking pleased with himself.  The deal was made, and <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> took his copy of the deed and rolled it into a scroll case.  He’d bought the smart leather case a few weeks ago, thinking it made him look like a serious professional who was organised and knew what he was doing.  He had yet to upgrade the rest of his appearance.  “What now then <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a>?  Can we go to the tavern? I heard those dancers are going to be at <a href=bio/Pantaloons>The Crusty Pantaloons</a> tonight.” <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> asked.  “Uh… I think it best you return to your father’s compound for the afternoon <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a>.  I’m going to um… check in with local businessmen and see what I can find out about potential jobs.  Yes, someone around here has to do some work” <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> said, hoping <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> would believe him.    He couldn’t wait to get to the Pantaloons and watch the dancers, but the thought of having an excited <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> cramping his style was loathsome.  “Oh… Ok Sir.  When shall I meet you for the recruitment drive?”  “Head over to the Pantaloons a little before the time we said on the poster.  There’s no need to be there too early, mind.”   “OK Sir” <a href=bio/Smim>Smim</a> repeated.  “See you later!” He walked off with great alacrity, clearly elated at the prospect of leaving <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> and getting back to civilisation.  <a href=bio/Bydalo>Bydalo</a> also shot off with haste, keen to get to the bar.  He was going to need quite a few cheap beers to make sleeping in seventy-three <a href=bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> tonight a possibility.    	</div>        <div class="content-player"><iframe width="100%" height="150" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137458249&color=%23040404&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false&visual=true"></iframe></div>    </div>    <!--<div class="character-box"><img src="images/test.png" width=120 height=120 /></div>--></body></html>
