halted at a hand signal from one of the female members.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;She was tall, slender, and had slightly messy brown hair that had been hurriedly tied up in a bun.&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not look particularly threatening, or dangerous in the streetwise-yet-cute way that <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a> was, but there was an aura of authority and coldness around her, and she didn't seem like somebody to cross. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her clothing was simple and pragmatic traveling gear that was well made and looked as though it had seen plenty of use, but had also been extremely well cared for.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore an insignia on her polished and oiled leather jerkin, pinned just below the clavicle on her left side, which identified her as affiliated with the town guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be where her authority came from then.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;With her were three very generic looking town guardsmen, all wearing the cheapest mail armour that tight-pursed politicians could buy.&nbsp;&nbsp;They showed no signs of discipline or professionalism, with their scruffy beards and blatant hangovers, and they were joking amongst themselves and taking swigs from wine flasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much to the annoyance of their leader.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> was piecing together information and thus far it seemed to him that the captain of the group was not a member of the town guard, but in fact an outsider brought in for their expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had likely been contracted for a more difficult mission and had then been stuck with the three chumps to help her. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth member did not match up as she had no town guard gear or insignias, and had until now been happily skipping along with the group, investigating flowers and trees and pointing out birds and sheep with glee.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was quite a bit shorter than <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a>, but on her back was the pack of an experienced traveller, with a flowery bedroll.&nbsp;&nbsp;What seemed most unusual was that her face was expertly made up like one of the beautiful cherubic women of the court, and her hair was a glorious blonde mane with girly plaits along one side.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Ranger?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> wondered.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had<span class=next>&nbsp;...

a little chubby, and he had the saddest excuse for a beard <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> had ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;It consisted of a countable number of hairs curling out of his second

the stream and back up the hill on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll see if the Woolguards can speak our language like <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Baarnaby>Baarnaby</a> - they might have some info for us,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> suggested hopefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They trotted down the hill to the edge of the stream, which was small enough

free wash.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they started up in the direction of the sheep a Woolguard approached them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They could now see that it was wielding a wooden branch that resembled a staff - and was marching forwards with it lowered in their direction.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hello there!\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Trufty>Trufty</a> said, raising his heirloom sword in salute and speaking with a slightly raised voice, hoping to sound non-threatening.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Woolguard froze and stared at them for a moment with an extremely stern look on his face - though it was hard to tell because of it's alien nature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly he threw his head back and let out a tremendous '<i>baa</i>' that echoed through the hills around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without further ado he resumed his march.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As he got to within charging distance of them he stopped and stood to attention, holding his staff-branch smartly by his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moments later two other Woolguards came trotting over to join him.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Looks like we've got the beginnings of a herd here!\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> joked, hoping to ease the sudden

them, as though they were words imbued with magic.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of them heard the voice of the ticket angel in their head, telling them it was going to send them home but they must stay still

and fear at a struggle that felt as though it had raged since the beginning of time.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ticket angel would stretch out tendrils towards them, and over and over the dark being would sever them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed determined to thwart the attempts of the angel to send them home.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans grew increasingly anxious and scared as it seemed that the ticket angel would never manage to reach them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight went on and on with neither being seeming to gain the upper hand - perhaps as though neither was supposed to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as they were beginning to despair, a new combatant entered the arena.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They barely saw whoever or whatever it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was merely a flicker of darkness that danced across the room, seeming to wrap around the head portion of the dark being.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;This apparently blinded it enough that the ticket angel was able to gain a momentary reprieve and spread it's tendrils quickly to the humans.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Aight guys, tell me about yo home quickly\"&nbsp;&nbsp;It said inside each of their heads.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They frantically tried to describe anything unique

another scratch.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not far to the appointed spot, and just before they reached it <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> had everyone stop and form a huddle so he could go

haunts for what felt like the first time in ages, they realised that the monster had seemed focused on this spot in particular.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors to their headquarters hadn't just been smashed, they'd been obliterated with such force that the wooden walls around them had been damaged as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the window shutters were either destroyed or hanging off.&nbsp;&nbsp;It even looked like there were scorch marks here and there.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Cap'n, maybe it'd be best if me and <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> took a look and the rest

crept forwards, again gently pushing the door inwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was even darker still in the back room, and he had to step in to adjust his eyes and begin to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes roved around the room at work surface level, noting broken glass and spilled ingredients everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;He then looked at the floor.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And had yet another mild heart

the monster with her sword held in both hands high over her head.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;She plunged it straight downwards, aiming for the beast's chest where presumably it's vital organs would be, if it had

minutes <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Sephra>Sephra</a> stood up, the monster's head hanging by it's very meagre patch of hair from her hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised it triumphantly, looking pretty

they came into close quarters with it, they once again felt the fear and awe that the massive beast inspired.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply looking upon it, they knew what kind of incomprehensible force it could deliver, and that any mistake would almost certainly cost them their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time around, they were not fresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;The adrenaline of the morning's combat had left them feeling

got to strike fast and overwhelmingly!\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> said to his people.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn't sure what the hell was going to happen when they did strike, but a tiny

to a room further down a corridor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere there were paintings, tapestries, plants, vases, and ornaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to admit, the house was beautifully looked after.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was carefully positioned in an aesthetically pleasing manner which lent to a sense of order and calm.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;How on earth had a household like this produced someone as incompetent as <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> wondered to himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best not to say it, it would be extremely rude in front of Delilah.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they entered the drawing room, <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a>'s father Nigel looked up from a book to see what was going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dressed in a comfortable white robe and had a glass of wine on a table beside him.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> and the others, he snapped his book shut and stood up from the simple wood chair he'd been sitting on.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed very out of place in this luxurious house, as it was bare and looked extremely uncomfortable.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> my boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why aren't you out there fighting off the end of the world?\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some awkward silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the polar

conscientious worker, but where <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Biggins>Biggins</a> was slightly fanatical and blustery, Nigel had an air of competence and a fierce edge to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no wonder he was a powerful and important man.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Slain many have you?\" Nigel asked in a controlled tone that almost masked his doubts.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He helped save me, <a

see if you might know anything about a clandestine government organisation that seems to be following us.\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a>'s father didn't react.&nbsp;&nbsp;He very deliberately did not react.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What is it that you think you know?\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Not much.&nbsp;&nbsp;We've been assisted at least three times by

continue.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Chief <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Biggins>Biggins</a> was the one who told us we were looking for someone within the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognised the dagger vaguely but didn't know anything more.&nbsp;&nbsp;He recommended that we don't pursue it, but we can't just ignore this.\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigel paused for a good while, considering what had been said.&nbsp;&nbsp;To <a target=\"_blank\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a>, this suggested that he knew <i>something</i> at the very least - and if he knew, then perhaps other magistrates or similar ranking

deepened the mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever he knew, he was unwilling to reveal it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps he worked with those involved, or perhaps he feared what they might do if he spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat back down, opened his book, and pretended to read as he waited for them to leave.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Delilah ushered them back to the foyer where she handed <a target=\"_blank\"
