Arissa%"No, silly!  A Woodsman's Way, part 2!  I love that book.  It also tells you how to secure a rampaging badger using only a turnip and a backpack"
Rinn%"If they wanted to keep getting chewed on for all eternity, who was he to stop them?"
Brob%"Don't worry about it, we'll smash those doggies!"

Rack%"Don't speak too soon girl, look at this!"
Smim%"We're not going to l-lie are we sir?"
Trufty%"I stand ready Rinn!  Though Arissa and I never had the chance to braid my hair up properly for the mission"
Sephra%"I ain't got the ingredients for your arse cream yet"
Rinn%"everybody will think you're just a bunch of wasters that met in an inn, downed five pints, and then decided to become famous heroes"
Rinn%"Unfortunately I'm not part owl, so I don't have superhuman vision"
Trufty%"Fear not Captain, I shall hold high my banner and they shall give us the road!"

Arissa%"Just wait til Sahana and Jemira hear about this, they're going to be, like, SO jealous!"
Rack%"Ain't no use in upsetting the law buddy.  They ain't nearly so righteous as they make out"
Rinn%"My name is Captain Rinn, and this here is my team of adventurers for hire.  Now, you may be wondering why we're all covered in blood..."
Brob%"Pies."
Arissa%"I don't know much about our mission but I heard that sheep were involved somewhere!"
Trufty%"What glorious crusade awaits us I wonder?"
Brob%"Alright old boy, nothing to it but to do it!"
Veralis%"SILENCE, CRIMINAL!  HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT ME!"
Biggins%"YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS CHIEF, OR SAH!  DO YOU GET ME?"
Biggins%"The rich fodder like yourself get chopped down in the opening seconds of a battle, giving you just long enough to wet your pants first!"
Biggins%"INSUBORDINATION!  COWARDICE!  DERELICTION OF DUTY!"
Biggins%"A stiff upper lip is mandatory."
Chauncey%"Chauncey is an appropriate name for a civilised intellectual!"
Chauncey%"Trust that jarhead Biggins to tell you next-to-nothing about your stupid mission..."
Chauncey%"Hey!  Put me down you buffoons!  Get off, I'm an intelligence wizard you can't lay hands on me!"
Chauncey%"The cretin designated as 'Brob' has unwittingly unleashed armageddon on us all!"
Batchley%"Egads!  What miserable misfortune and woe."
Batchley%"I was born about one-hundred-and-forty years ago... although I don't remember when exactly."
Batchley%"If you keep journeying the planes and don't rustle any jimmies you can live a jolly long time!"
Batchley%"My fleshy friends here were in a spot of bother - it's their first time travelling the planes you see"
Freki%"Arooooooooooo"
Baarnaby%"Eggs and bacon, no mutton"
Beetroot%"Yeeee c'mon girl, come and sit next to ol' Beetroot!"
Chadley%"We'll leave you to your beauty sleep, heroes can't waste time in the barracks I'm afraid"
Sephra%"I hate how turned on I am right now."
