Arissa%"No, silly!  A Woodsman's Way, part 2!  I love that book.  It also tells you how to secure a rampaging badger using only a turnip and a backpack"
Rinn%"If they wanted to keep getting chewed on for all eternity, who was he to stop them?"
Brob%"Don't worry about it, we'll smash those doggies!"
Sephra%"That's OK, I've woken up in worse places with no memory of how I got there"
Rack%"Don't speak too soon girl, look at this!"
Smim%"We're not going to l-lie are we sir?"
Trufty%"I stand ready Rinn!  Though Arissa and I never had the chance to braid my hair up properly for the mission"
Sephra%"I ain't got the ingredients for your arse cream yet"
Rinn%"everybody will think you're just a bunch of wasters that met in an inn, downed five pints, and then decided to become famous heroes"
Rinn%"Unfortunately I'm not part owl, so I don't have superhuman vision"
Trufty%"Fear not Captain, I shall hold high my banner and they shall give us the road!"
Esmeldrana%"You are required by the authority of the town guard to submit yourselves to this investigative body"
Arissa%"Just wait til Sahana and Jemira hear about this, they're going to be, like, SO jealous!"
Rack%"Ain't no use in upsetting the law buddy.  They ain't nearly so righteous as they make out"
Rinn%"My name is Captain Rinn, and this here is my team of adventurers for hire.  Now, you may be wondering why we're all covered in blood..."
Brob%"Pies."
Arissa%"I don't know much about our mission but I heard that sheep were involved somewhere!"
Trufty%"What glorious crusade awaits us I wonder?"
Brob%"Alright old boy, nothing to it but to do it!"
Veralis%"SILENCE, CRIMINAL!  HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT ME!"
Biggins%"YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS CHIEF, OR SAH!  DO YOU GET ME?"
Biggins%"The rich fodder like yourself get chopped down in the opening seconds of a battle, giving you just long enough to wet your pants first!"
Biggins%"INSUBORDINATION!  COWARDICE!  DERELICTION OF DUTY!"
Biggins%"A stiff upper lip is mandatory."
Chauncey%"Chauncey is an appropriate name for a civilised intellectual!"
Chauncey%"Trust that jarhead Biggins to tell you next-to-nothing about your stupid mission..."
Chauncey%"Hey!  Put me down you buffoons!  Get off, I'm an intelligence wizard you can't lay hands on me!"
Chauncey%"The cretin designated as 'Brob' has unwittingly unleashed armageddon on us all!"
Batchley%"Egads!  What miserable misfortune and woe."
Batchley%"I was born about one-hundred-and-forty years ago... although I don't remember when exactly."
Batchley%"If you keep journeying the planes and don't rustle any jimmies you can live a jolly long time!"
Batchley%"My fleshy friends here were in a spot of bother - it's their first time travelling the planes you see"
Freki%"Arooooooooooo"
Baarnaby%"Eggs and bacon, no mutton"
Beetroot%"Yeeee c'mon girl, come and sit next to ol' Beetroot!"
Chadley%"We'll leave you to your beauty sleep, heroes can't waste time in the barracks I'm afraid"
Sephra%"I hate how turned on I am right now."
Brob%"There's no rope in the world that can hold me"
Brob%"Neat trick!  I could have broken it down though, saved you the trouble!"
Brob%"Well, isn't that a strange coincedence, I've suddenly come over all thirsty!"
Brob%"Woah, woah, woah!  I've only just got a fresh pint!"
Rack%"Ahh come on Trufty, ain't nothin' wrong with a lil' rough-housing"
Rack%"It's late and we're a bit sauced"
Smim%"Yeah, let's investigate their cahoots!"
Sephra%"I don't think there's enough arse cream in Bog Street to fix that mess"
Sephra%"This one's definitely a wizard.  Or will be in a few years... he doesn't look thirty yet"
Sephra%"This place would be great for picnics... with a few good brews"
Smim%"Sir, I'm running out of paper for our journal already.  This is all a bit much isn't it?  I don't even know what's real anymore"
Smim%"Hello father, this is my squad... we've... we've been fighting monsters and helping"
Chadley%"Let's get stuck in!  and if this thing kills me, then let it sell my bones!"
Chadley%"Johnno over here almost snuffed it"
Dathory%"You have been through a lot, and from the sounds of it you have comported yourselves with honour"
Nigel and Delilah%"My darling little Smimsykins!  Oh, how wonderful to see you!"
Nigel and Delilah%"Smim my boy.  Why aren't you out there fighting off the end of the world?"
Nigel and Delilah%"Slain many have you?"
Ticket Angel%"Ey yo, wassup?  Dis foe is beyond you man, get outta here!"
Ticket Angel%"Anything else weird happen back in yo crib?"
Agent Serenity%*Happy dog noises*
Veralis%"SILENCE, CRIMINAL!  HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT ME!"
Veralis%"Nonsense.  This entire story is a wicked lie which you and your murdering ilk have fabricated"
Veralis%"Yes, yes, I've heard his fairy tale already Captain.  What made you so sure that their alibi was feasible?"
Pyeter%"Ahh, to be a young man again!  You've got that glint in your eye"
Pyeter%"This truly is the blade of a knight, and a great one"
