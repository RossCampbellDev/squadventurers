by a strange looking fellow holding a glowing lamp.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was roughly middle-aged, and looked extremely haggard.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had long, patchy stubble on his face, unkempt hair, dirty skin, and the most awful collection of ragged clothing <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> had ever seen - he even made <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rack')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a> look sophisticated.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet there was something about him that reminded <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> of <a target=\"_blank\"

paint over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We was just havin' some fun,\" <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rack')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rack>Rack</a> said in his deep and creamy voice.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> threw his hands up in surrender.&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn't exactly any hurry to have the place done up but he'd have liked it to be sooner rather than later.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus he also felt a bit left out.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Albert.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So, what is it that <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Biggins>Biggins</a> has sent you here for?\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The great military

work here righting the wrongs you've done, but you still have a responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody said it was going to be pleasant keeping the civvies in the dark - least of all me, I've fought for

the small protest had been gathering outside the governor's private residence.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not far from the Magistrate's courthouse, though in a much nicer gated community that would likely be

couple of beers each and the rest of the night to blow hot air at eachother, but fortunately there was a job to do.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at the Governor's house, they found a small crowd of around fifteen civilians of varying ages and appearances, a few of them holding torches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most were waving their fists in the air and speaking various grudges forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposite them was a slightly smaller crowd, a short distance away, that was yelling things back at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently the two sides were in disagreement.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the front door to the Governor's

like the look the situation - it could boil over easily if one of the guards took a careless action out of fear.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The chanting and shouting of the crowds was likely annoying other local

href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a>, he strode out into the space that still remained with his arms out by his sides in a gesture of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to shout over the racket that he was there on behalf of the town guard to keep the peace, but he wasn't sure anyone paid him any mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, they didn't seem to take issue with him or the squad moving in.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We demand the truth about these monster attacks!\" one protestor within the original crowd shouted.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The people must know what is really happening!\" said another.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why are the town guard allowing the monsters to destroy our lives?\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The signs that their comrades were holding bore messages such as 'no more lies' and 'truth and justice for all'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many people in the city could read or write, never mind afford paper and ink, so the presence of the signs spoke as to the status of the protestors.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the divide on the other side, opposing forces were retaliating with their own ideas.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We stand with the town guard and the Governor!\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The people must stay safe at home and not provoke the enemy!\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they didn't know who 'the enemy' actually was, but that didn't stop them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad hung about for quite a while listening to the pointless shouting, slowly developing headaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were grateful that it had not yet devolved into violence, but the energy levels were steadily climbing and there was an unpleasant atmosphere.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If only we could quieten everybody down and have a reasonable discussion,\" <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Trufty')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\"
