and held it in his scabby right hand, leading them along narrow corridors full of cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they were not bound and there were six of them to his one, nobody considered trying to run away.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality the jailor had no chance of keeping up with them, but escape somehow seemed impossible anyway.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they trudged past the cells, they were sometimes greeted with rude words, grasping hands, or gobs of spit from within the darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few times it happened they jumped back in horror, but they quickly got used to

any sunlight through due to the level of grime coating the panes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the courthouse had been immaculate and treated with care, the town guard barracks were mouldering away with neglect.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps once the building had been a proud monument to protecting the people, but that must have been long ago.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they reached the main entrance, a

dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their instructors were yelling harshly at them to little avail.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very center of the courtyard was the shortest man <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\"

he wore perfectly fitted plate mail with a high quality tabard over the top, bearing the crest of the town guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;At his waist was a simple mace, hanging from a belt loop.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging by the respect shown to him by those around, and by his magnificently over-the-top plumed helmet, this had to the be chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was bawling orders from under a tremendous moustache, louder than all of the drill sergeants, in a very powerful voice that had the saw-edged sound of a man with years of military experience.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they drew near, he noticed them and spun an about-turn to face them, freezing neatly at attention for a moment before marching brusquely towards them.&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled up just short of one of the bailiffs, looking directly over the bailiff's head with a fierce expression.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Good afternoon lad, are these the blighters who were suspected of the serial murders?&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak quickly!\" He belted, far louder than necessary.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yeah, these is them,\" the bailiff answered in his monotonous drone.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This is them... SAH!\" the Chief responded, correcting his etiquette and sprinkling the man's face with spittle.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped the saliva away slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"These is them... sir...\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Right!&nbsp;&nbsp;Get yourself squared away and back to the court and tell the Magistrate's assistant that the group has been delivered to it's destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll take it from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hup two, hup two, hup two!\" he chanted as he chased the bailiffs away with a drill stick for a few moments before returning to stand before <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> -

hunched over, to his desk where he collapsed in his seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said nothing, and the group waited awkwardly for a little while as the wizard regained his composure and settled his emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretended to shuffle papers and consider them in the meantime so that he looked important and busy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The true pathway <i>to</i> the sheep dimension is in the containment room.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's two doors down from this one and the walls are double-thick, lined with lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a gateway in that room which arrived here long before I did - and knowledge of it's existence is trusted to only a select few individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have now been granted this knowledge, you are automatically sworn to secrecy and

with the familiar 'here we go again, out of the frying pan...' expression that had become common in the past few days.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick jaunt down the hallway saw them standing before a mundane looking door behind a grumpy <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Chauncey>Chauncey</a> who was digging in his pockets in a hurried fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments he withdrew not a key as they had expected, but a strange glove of some kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;The material was flexible like any regular woolen mitt, but it had a metallic appearance that almost flowed like liquid.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was most beautiful.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped before the door and began chanting the words to yet another spell.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to begrudgingly admit that <a

emanating from within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Chauncey>Chauncey</a> pulled it carefully over his right hand and marveled at his own

asked.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Woolguards looked to eachother uneasily, and Peepridge chose this moment to drop some little black sheep nuggets.&nbsp;&nbsp;He acted as though this was a perfectly normal thing to do during conversation with a stranger, but the gang were horrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;They remained polite however, as they were the outsiders here and didn't have the best track record when it came to offending strangers over the last few days.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Peepridge continued on, oblivious to their discomfort.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The second request we cannot help you with, as we know of no such sheep, but the first is something you should reconsider.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Freki>Freki</a>, he is one of the Lupredators and is

lifted his staff and gestured his head over one shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;An ear flicked out at a cute bimbling fly.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I will take you some of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;My two companions will

intense and if he was honest he just fancied a pint right about now.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"How do we know which way is West?&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is directly above us,\" he asked.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"How odd,\" Peepridge said, sounding not at all interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We derive West by observing The Flock.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice they all face roughly the same direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;They face East.\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why's that?\" <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> asked, silently wondering

class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> thought he'd better leave it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheep back home were pretty unoriginal thinkers, and it seemed they might be the same here.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they set off to the West, eventually running into more Flocks and Woolguards, and were given the same 'go West' instructions of Peepridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;They began to wonder if it had actually just been a joke, or a quick way of getting them away from The Flock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this whole plane was one big wind-up?&nbsp;&nbsp;It did seem a bit too whimsical.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My feet are sore,\" <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> complained from somewhere in the back of the

was pretty nice.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> shrugged and smiled, enjoying something going their way for once.<br/><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;After some more walking they began to hear the now-familiar sheep sounds from over the next hill and their pace quickened a little as the

spines.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may have been the sheep world, but back home that same danger walked the earth and it was very real.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective howling filled the air, the throats of many wolves joining in a bloodcurdling choir which foretold of the eternal struggle for survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;A light course of adrenaline pulsed through their veins and they all looked uneasily at

said goodbye to the Woolguards who were cleaning away the mess from the battle, and gathered around the reinvigorated old man.&nbsp;&nbsp;He instructed them to find their old ticket-coins and hold them in an outstretched palm, while closing their eyes and thinking hard on where they wanted to travel.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was happening, until suddenly they were dropped unceremoniously into a

they could claim as their own.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A place to congregate, tell stories, make plans, and above all - stay out of sight and out of mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inhabitants had tried to give it a more pleasant name, but unfortunately the somewhat offensive colloquial one had stuck.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They had done deals and made supply trips in order to bring the construction materials to their new home, setting up basic but functional houses, inns, shops, and dentists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooth problems were all too common, and when you were living such an extremely long time your gnashers were incredibly important!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Come my little star-walking friends, I shall introduce you to the gents down at my club.&nbsp;&nbsp;They're a good sort, someone will be able to help you out

friends.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They stopped at the front door and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Batchley>Batchley</a> rapped out a complex series of knocks and taps, then stepped

complain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The window slapped shut, the door opened, and in they walked.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the rest of Ghoul Town, it was not deathly quiet inside the clubhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed through several corridors full of closed doors and reached a bar that had a few severely aged people in it, sitting and sipping on small glasses of fortified wine while chatting boisterously<span

aesthetic of a gravedigger's toolbox, the inside of the clubhouse bar was lavish and inviting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The armchairs looked comfy, there was a lively fire spreading warmth, and there were

the room the general hubbub quietened and there were several cheery greetings spoken to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Batchley>Batchley</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the exposed eyeballs quickly found their way to the squad, curious about an uncommon visit from young folk.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Good afternoon gentlemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to introduce some young adventurers - explorers

might be able to be of assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;They're in need of work so they can buy tickets home...\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice trailed away hopefully at the end of the sentence, as if expecting them to jump at the chance at some cheap labour.&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What sort of work can you do?\" someone asked after an awkward pause.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> took it as his moment to finally join the

over to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even among this crowd he looked aged, which really was saying something.&nbsp;&nbsp;He removed his hat, revealing a face with almost no flesh remaining on it whatsoever, and

onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a>'s soul and then stepped back, seemingly satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp;He informed them of where they could find his

stay the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll not fit in my house but not to worry - the club shall provide!&nbsp;&nbsp;There are spare rooms here you may use.\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They thanked him and found seats in the bar area, unsure what else to do other than have a pint and wait for all this to blow over.&nbsp;&nbsp;They chatted a little with some of the more curious and interested members of the club, telling of their journey and their homeworld.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were an amiable lot, even if they did look like something from a nightmare.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;At one point <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event,

target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> subconsciously recognised, and he was overcome by a sudden wave of awkwardness.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I wanted to thank you for saving my

house.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already awaiting them when they arrived, holding a mop and standing by several buckets at the front door.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Good morning little elves!\" he said

certainly not going to be either of those two things.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was going to be a long and arduous task.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gankaxx's shower drain was actually quite long and large, having been knocked together by some crude craftsman with no idea what plumbing actually was - and it wasn't only blocked up with hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was rotten flesh down there which had gotten sodden and rotted some more, all mixed in with hair and dirty water and probably a dead rat or two as well.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was utterly putrid.&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that they had only really needed one bucket for removing the slop of the shower, and the rest had been for catching vomit instead.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They each took turns with various hooks and bits of wire, trying to pull every last morsel of horrendous decay out of the drain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying desperately to convince themselves that they were not touching it with bare skin when picking it up.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;At one point <a

provided for free, something strange entered the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the things they'd seen recently, this was one of the oddest.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A child stepped into the room, announcing that he was there to sweep the chimneys.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was odd was that he was almost as rotten as the rest of the Ghoul Town residents - which didn't make sense as far as the visitors reckoned, since the rot was supposedly due to outliving normal biological clocks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\"

and gave the door two light taps that a guard dog would have struggled to hear.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Out of the way laddie,\" <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Brob')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Brob>Brob</a> said, unimpressed by the hesitant display, and still full of beer.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave the door five forceful knocks and stepped back, hands on hips.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, there came the sound of several dogs barking.&nbsp;&nbsp;They sounded like the type that would be quite keen to eat your knackers for

onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> nodded graciously and they all stepped into the foyer once the dogs had been taken to another

homesick.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Half of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Bogstreet>Bog Street</a> could live in here with room to spare...\" she mused.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she would be justified in it, she did not feel any resentment towards <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> and his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the way of the world.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Come on through darlings,\" said Delilah, ushering them past the large staircase in the center of the foyer and to a room further down a corridor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere there were paintings, tapestries, plants, vases, and ornaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to admit, the house was beautifully looked after.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was carefully positioned in an aesthetically pleasing manner which lent to a sense of order and calm.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;How on earth could a household like this produce someone as incompetent as <a

target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> wondered to himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best not to say it of course, it would be extremely rude in front of Delilah.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As they entered the drawing room, <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a>'s father Nigel looked up from a book to see what was going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dressed in a comfortable white robe and had a glass of wine on a table beside him.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> and the others, he snapped his book shut and stood up from the simple wood chair he'd been sitting on.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed very out of place in this luxurious house, as it was bare and looked extremely uncomfortable.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\"

some awkward silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the polar opposite of the warm welcome Delilah had given them, and the squad was surprised by the cold 'straight to business' approach.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hello father.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my squad... we've... we've been fighting monsters and helping,\" <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Smim')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Smim>Smim</a> said lamely.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood nervously, almost as though he was being inspected by <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\"

replied.&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt an instinctive urge to be frosty toward Nigel, even though right now they needed a favour from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was my idea to see if you might know anything about a

giving any outward reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> decided to

'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a>, this suggested that he knew <i>something</i> at the very least - and if he knew, then perhaps other

the Prelate was no small thing, and to bear the news of a highly spiritual and troubling matter such as the apocalypse was a big deal.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He clasped his hands, decision

visitors, the Prelate smartly dismissed his knights to practice sword and shield drills among themselves, and strode over to see what was going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a tall and robust man, with neatly cropped black hair and beard.&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes were an unusually pale blue, and contrasted with the weather-beaten appearance of his skin.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The caretaker began

that you need?\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Answers to two questions, if you are able?\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dathory nodded and said he would do whatever he could, and so <a onmouseover=\"showHint(event, 'Rinn')\" onmouseout=\"hideHint()\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"char-anchor\" href=/bio/Rinn>Rinn</a> described the vague situation with their followers and apparent protectors, and enquired as to whether the

issuing commands to the knights, followed by the clatter of plate armour as the men hastily ran to collect their things.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"May they all return in one piece,\" Pyeter said quietly to himself before turning to face the adventurers.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Now then.&nbsp;&nbsp;Find yourselves a seat, for there is no time to spare and there is much that you must learn.\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;They all scrabbled around trying to find the best chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;The library was not a large room, and since it was so full of shelving that held hundreds of scrolls and books, there was very little room.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, chairs sat individually on narrow cul-de-sacs, usually with more books and old candles sat idly on top of them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once everyone had settled, Pyeter emerged from one such cul-de-sac carrying a huge book with a thick cover that was lined with frayed old red velvet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of paper were thick and had become slightly warped with age and use, and the odd spillage of tea.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The old caretaker took great care with the book, carefully laying it upon an ornate wooden reading stand that had a great eagle carved in the front.&nbsp;&nbsp;He reverently opened it to the first page and softly blew away a layer of dust.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He peered up at them over the top of the book, and gave each of them an intense stare to judge whether they were ready to pay attention or not.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I will not read everything here to you for that would take too long, but there is knowledge within this tome which the order

seat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is believed that though the primary source of order in this world is an amalgam of the actions of ordinary folk, there is also a higher tier of elites that
